# Anvil of Destiny
A mod for Noita (https://noitagame.com/) which adds rooms with an anvil into the default biomes, which lets you forge and improve wands!

## Do NOT just download/clone this master branch, it has a lot of crap for developing only and will have lots of bugs!

Where can you find these anvils? They appear randomly in the default biomes (Mines, Coal Pits etc), roughly once per biome, with more in the later ones because they are bigger.

You can throw wands and items by opening your inventory and dragging them out into the gameworld.

__Here's a video showing how it works: https://youtu.be/0bQ_mSQb-8E__

Here are the current recipes:
### 🌟 2 Wands = New wand roughly 1 level better
The output is based on the stats and rough spell level of the input wand
### 🌟 1 Tablet + 2 Wands = Same as above but the new wand will have 1 additional random guaranteed always cast spell
### 🌟 2 Tablets + 1 Wand = Just buff the input wand's stats

## That's it, have fun forging with the holy 🙏 __Anvil of DESTINY__ 🙏!
